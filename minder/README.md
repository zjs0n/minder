# minder

An application that lets users specify their movie preferences (e.g. genre, actors, directors, year released, rating) and gives movie recommendations that the user can swipe through until they find one they like. User preferences can be weighted by importance to filter through movies more easily as well. Users can also click into movies to view detailed information about the movies. 

There will be a swiping page, a trending page, a recommendation page, a review page, an individual movie page, and a profile page.

There will be a client side directory to handle the frontend and a server side directory to handle the backend

### Instructions for running Minder locally

The process of running the application locally is very similar to the steps provided for Homework 2.

1. Open a new terminal and cd into the server folder. Run npm install.
2. Open another terminal and cd into the client folder. Run npm install.
3. In the server terminal, run npm start. Do the same in the client terminal and you should be all set!
